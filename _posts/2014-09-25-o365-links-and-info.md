## Updates
### Support Timeframes on Click to Run Packages

> A monthly build is available for download from Office 365 for up to one year (12 months). After that, the build is no longer supported. Administrators should check that their Office 365 ProPlus installations use a supported build that contains updates within the last year.

* [Overview of Click-to-Run for Office 365 setup architecture](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj219420%28v=office.15%29.aspx#BKMK_C2RUpdates)

> The Microsoft Service Pack Support Lifecycle Policy requires you to install Office Service Packs within 12 months of its release. Office 365 requires you to be in compliance with this policy.

> Automatic public updates contain critical security fixes for Microsoft products. Office 365 strongly recommends that customers accept automatic updates from Microsoft both to secure their environments and to have the best experience with Office 365. Office 365 ProPlus and Lync Basic users can only defer installing updates for 12 months from date of release.
