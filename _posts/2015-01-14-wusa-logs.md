title: Logfiles and Windows Update Standalone Installer

Running `wusa /?` it wasn't immediately obvious to me that you needed to specify the log file as part of the `/log` parameter, and that it outputs it in the _Windows XML Event Log_ format. An example command might be `wusa <update> /quiet /norestart /logfile:"%TEMP%\wusalog.evtx"`

If you see error 0x80240016 while trying to install updates, it usually means that another installation is already in progress.
